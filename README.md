# ✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is part of **The Odin Project's Foundation curriculum**, where I created a **Rock Paper Scissors** game using **JavaScript**. The game is played in the Browser with 3 Buttons and the "Computer" pics one of the three options randomly, over five rounds.

## 🌟 Features

- Play a 5-round game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.
- The game keeps track of the score for both the player and the computer.
- Input for the human player is made with 3 Buttons.
- The winner is declared after 5 rounds based on the scores.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: For the game logic and functionality.
- **Browser Console**: For user interaction and displaying game results.

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced the following skills:

- Writing **JavaScript functions** to implement game logic.
- Using **Math.random()** to simulate random choices for the computer.
- Handling user input using the **prompt()** function.
- Working with **conditionals** to determine the game results (win, lose, draw).
- Keeping track of and updating **scores** using global variables.
- Structuring a simple interactive game and testing it via the browser's console.
- Refactor the game to interact and display directly too the page
- Managing the project with **Git** and pushing it to **GitHub**.
